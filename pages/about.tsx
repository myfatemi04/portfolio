        I'm <strong>Michael Fatemi,</strong> a app developer and machine
        learning enthusiast.

        I'm a student at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
        Technology, where I'm an active member of the machine learning club,
        student government, varsity track, and the Rubik's Cube Club. I'm
        currently working on a research project to locate and classify sounds
        and display them in augmented reality. I have taken courses in computer
        vision, artificial intelligence, mobile and web app development, and
        machine learning.

        Python, built the enrollment system that was used by thousands of
        students, and organized workshops in machine learning, game development,
        and computer vision.
