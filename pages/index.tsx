          <p>
            I'm a student at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
            Technology, where I'm an active member of the machine learning club,
            student government, varsity track, and the Rubik's Cube Club. I'm
            currently working on a research project to locate and classify
            sounds and display them in augmented reality. I have taken courses
            in computer vision, artificial intelligence, mobile and web app
            development, and machine learning.

            thousands of students, and organized workshops in machine learning,
            game development, and computer vision.
