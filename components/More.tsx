        <b>Varsity Track Team</b>
        <br />
        Track is one of the best high school sports. No question. :)
        <br />
        I'm a distance runner, with hopes of being able to run a mile in under
        five minutes by my senior year.

        <b>Student Government & Advocacy</b>
        <br />I created a complete redesign of{" "}
        <a href="https://sga.tjhsst.edu/">the student government website</a>.
        It's{" "}
        <a href="https://www.github.com/tjsga/tj-sga-website-react">
          open source
        </a>
        ! <br />
        <br />I also started a movement that led to one of the first
        equally-voiced town halls about the admissions process to my school.
