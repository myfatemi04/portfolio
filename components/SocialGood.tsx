      <p>
        <b>I've been coding since 2013.</b> When I was admitted to the Thomas
        Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, I took a test to
        qualify to take AP Computer Science with Data Structures as a freshman.
        I've built several apps with React, one of the most highly-demanded app
        development frameworks. I'm currently in the process of learning Torch,
        a Machine Learning framework. I've completed HuggingFace's course on
        natural language transformers.
