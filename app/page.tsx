      <p>
        In this project, I sought to create a way to use language models for
        research-oriented writing. It provided the following primary features:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A writing assistant with drag-and-drop text completions from
            external documents, with an integrated Bing search tab that enabled
            quick access (Left video, above)
          </li>
          <li>
            A research assistant that enabled a natural language summary of top
            Bing search results with citations (Right video, above)
          </li>
        </ul>
        This was implemented as a React app (code is{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/myfatemi04/amai-playground/">here</a>) and a
        set of AWS Lambda functions (code is{" "}

        backend used OAuth2 for authentication and a MongoDB database to store

        <code>text-davinci-003</code> model for text generation. I eventually
        reached 10 paid users (yay!), and I shut down the project when ChatGPT

      </em>
      <p>
        For a year-long student research project in high school, I made a "sound
        camera" with a Raspberry Pi, an embedded webcam, and a microphone array.
        It is capable of detecting the locations of sounds within 8ยบ of accuracy
        purely through a grid of microphones, and displaying them in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        To handle conflicting sounds from multiple frequencies, I improved upon
        an existing algorithm (Steered-Response Power Phase Transform/SRP-PHAT)
        by using a Discrete Fourier Transform to separate a measured signal into
        segmented frequency bounds and then convert those back into the time
        domain with an inverse transform. This was helpful because loud,
        low-frequency sounds (such as ambient noise) would sometimes drown out
        higher-frequency, meaningful sounds (such as voices).
      </p>
      <p>
        I then created an algorithm written in C to assess potential directions
        of arrival and connected a webcam to enable visualization . Most of my
        code is on my own repository,{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/myfatemi04/sound-camera">
          <code>sound-camera</code>
        </a>
        , but I also added some tools I created to another open-source library,{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/introlab/odas">
          <code>ODAS</code>
        </a>
        , which has 700 stars.

              Some existing techniques for robotic path planning use algorithmic
              optimizers to find the best path. However, as the length and
              constraints applied to the path become more complex, it becomes
              impractical to try to find a globally optimal solution.

                To address this, I used reinforcement learning to train a neural
                network to generate paths for an agent moving along a grid with

              Developing natural language processing techniques to scale up the
